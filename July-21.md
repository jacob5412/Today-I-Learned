# July 2021

## 5th July 2021

* When ideatating during an OKR, don't ask the question directly related to the OKR.
* Think of a question that will help direct the discussion in the right direction.
* Don't think of surface level questions.

## 6th July 2021: What is Analytics?

* Analytics:
  * to figure out patterns
  * bulding blocks of data analytics --> metrics (something you can measure)
  * use metrics to take a qualitative thing and give a quantitative answer to
* Types of metrics
  * Scale Neutral vs Unneutral:
    * The first doesn't change with an increases number of observations. e.g. Average height of individuals would be the almost the same for 1000 vs 100000 people
    * The second does. e.g. Revenue generated from 1000 vs 100000 customers
  * Comparing metrics - absolutely or relatively
  * Based on when the effect is visible. e.g. an acquistion project (long term) vs a retention project (readily observable)
* Proxy metrics - sometimes if you don't have time to measure long term metrics, you use a metric that will indicate something similar. e.g. what can you measure that'll tell you that you're lead towards retention?
* Benchmark your metrics against something to convey the scale of the change
* Relationship among variables:
  * How are 2 or more things related with each other?
  * Changing which thing influences the other
    * What is the causing factor and what is the effective factor?
  * Correlation: "expresses the extent to which two variables are linearly related (meaning they change together at a constant rate)."
  * Sometimes, you need to find whether it's a direct effect or an indirect effect. If it's indirect, you need to identify the links.
  * It's difficult to identify the causing factor and effecting factor. e.g. does unhealthiness lead to laziness or vice versa?
  * To find cause and effect in a controlled environment --> experiment
* Distributions
  * How spread out your data is?
  * Measures of central tendency = mean, median, mode (mean --> expected value)
* Experimentation
  * Why sample the population?
    * Sample will have errors
    * But it's expensive to take entire population - can't sample everyone (and simultaneously)
    * An Ideal sample should be representative of your population
  * Types of sampling bias [Source](https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/sampling-bias/), e.g.
    * Selection
    * Supervisorship
    * Self-selection
    * Undercoverage
    * Non-response

* Permutations: Fancy way of saying how things are arranged

## 10th July: Quality check

* Data Analysis isn't just about writing code/queries, but also about what output you generated is correct.
* Always QC your data against a known source of truth.
