TIL that in the consulting world the process of working on a problem is as follows:

1. List out all the factors of a problem (using the top-down approach)
2. Select the factor(s) that are high impact or those that the client wants to focus on
3. Data requirement gathering:
   1. Submit a list to request the data you need for your analysis, along with a reason why you require each column
   2. Data is sensistive, client would want to know why exactly you're using their data
4. Problem identification and validation:
   1. Does the data indicate the scale or the root cause of the problem?
   2. Is there sufficient evidence?
   3. Is there a statistical basis?
5. Conclusion
